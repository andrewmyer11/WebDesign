# The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
# Ben Stiller
I truly enjoy this film because it makes you truly want to go out on adventure and not stay in the same city for your whole life. I also am a big photographer so when I first saw this film I was able to connect with it in a way because there are so many great shots taken in this film that make you want to try those same camera shots. I like how the film has Ben (Walter) kinda drift of into these daydreams of things that he thought he could do to certain people because he either disliked them or he had a intrest in a woman.
