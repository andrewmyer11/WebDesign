        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>In this film, at the start it really goes into depth on the type of movie that this will be. This made it more interesting for me to watch as I felt like I was in my own world.</p>

    <!-- Chapter 2 -->
    <section class="chapter-heading">
        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
        <p>I truly feel like this movie changes people’s lives. I have heard from a good number of people that it inspires them to live more fully. At the start, it may not seem like it could touch your heart, but by the end you want to pursue your dreams. My favorite part is when Walter goes on a big adventure to find the final photo for LIFE magazine. He travels to find the photographer, passing through amazing places, and finally meets him while hiking.</p>
