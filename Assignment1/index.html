 <h3>chapter 1</h3>
<p>In this film there at the start of the film it really goes into depth on the type of movie that this 
    will be from the start.</p><p>This just made it more intresting for me to watch as I felt like I was in my own world.

 <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>I truly feel like this movie changes peoples lives, now I am not just saying that I have heard from a good amount of people that have seen the movie 
say that it truly makes people want to live more in life. There is something about the way that this movie that doesn't seem like it could touch your 
heart at the start of the movie, but by the end of it you want to strive after whatever that dream is of yours that you might have been to scared to 
go for. My favorite part about this film is when Walter goes on this big adventure to find the final film piece for LIFE magazine. He can't find it 
anywhere so he travels to the man that took that picture, but it takes him through all these amazing places and finally he is hiking and sees the man
that took it. </p>
